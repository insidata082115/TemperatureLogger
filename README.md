TemperatureLogger
=================

A fully functional and beautiful sample app that showcases how to log data from the internal on-die temperature sensor of the Metawear and visualize it using JBCharts.

## ATTENTION!
We use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) for dependency management, this means you need to open **TempLogger.xcworkspace** and not TempLogger.xcodeproj.
